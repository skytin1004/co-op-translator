## Responsible AI

Microsoft dey try make sure say people dey use our AI products well, dey share wetin we learn, and dey build trust with tools like Transparency Notes and Impact Assessments. You fit see many of these things for [https://aka.ms/RAI](https://aka.ms/RAI).
How Microsoft dey do responsible AI na based on our AI principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Big AI models wey dey do language, image, and speech - like the ones wey this sample dey use - fit sometimes do things wey no good, wey fit cause wahala. Abeg check [Azure OpenAI service Transparency note](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) so you go sabi the risk and limitation.

The best way to avoid wahala na to add safety system for your setup wey fit see and stop bad behaviour. [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) fit help you as extra protection, e fit see bad content wey people or AI generate for your app or service. Azure AI Content Safety get text and image APIs wey fit help you see bad things. We still get Content Safety Studio wey you fit use test and try code wey dey detect bad content for different type. This [quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/quickstart-text?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux&pivots=programming-language-rest) go show you how to send request to the service.
Another thing wey you suppose reason na how the whole app dey perform. For apps wey get plenty mode and plenty model, when we talk performance, e mean say the system dey do wetin you and your users dey expect, plus e no dey produce wahala output. E good make you check how your whole app dey perform with [generation quality and risk and safety metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in).

You fit test your AI app for where you dey build am with the [prompt flow SDK](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html). If you get test dataset or target, your generative AI app go dey measure with built-in evaluators or any custom evaluator wey you like. To start with prompt flow sdk to test your system, just follow the [quickstart guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/develop/flow-evaluate-sdk). After you run the evaluation, you fit [see the results for Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/how-to/evaluate-flow-results).
